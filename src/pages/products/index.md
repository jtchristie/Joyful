        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

    quote: '"Gail is an extraordinary healer. My sessions with her are profoundly
      calming and invigorating all at the same time. Gail speaks softly yet
      carries a big heart. My recommendations: if you are looking for calmness,
      ease and inner peace, Gail and Holy Fire Reiki will provide that. I have
      weekly sessions that keep me peaceful, grounded and on purpose. Thank you
      Gail for your expression of love through Reiki!"  '
  - author: Meredith M.
    quote: '"Gail has a calm demeanor that invites relaxation. Her Reiki session was
      soothing and I left feeling balanced. The stress of my day melted away and
      I was in a much more positive frame of mind afterward. I highly recommend
      a series of sessions with Gail as part of regular self-care."'
