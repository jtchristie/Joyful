        HOLY FIRE® REIKI is a powerful, yet gentle healing energy that relieves
        stress, provides deep relaxation, and awakens your body's own ability to
        heal. It has a particularly high vibration and carries the energy of
        unconditional love.

        REIKI PACKAGES are offered to provide you an affordable option to experience the cumulative, long-term benefits of Reiki. When experienced in a series, Reiki treatments are even more effective in promoting healing from the effects of stress, trauma, illness, surgery or chemotherapy.

    Reiki is a gift of life force energy given to us to renew and heal ourselves
    and others. The Holy Fire III Reiki placement (similar to an attunement)
    sensitizes you to the frequency of Reiki energy by opening your energy
    field, clearing blocked energy, and allowing you to become a clear channel
    for Reiki healing.

    The following classes all include Holy Fire Reiki energies. Reiki energy is constantly evolving and Holy Fire III is one of the most recent forms. It is both powerful and gentle. It is noticeably refined and provides          purification, healing, and guidance. It carries a very high vibration, which improves your connection to universal energy and unconditional love.

    quote: '"Gail is an extraordinary healer. My sessions with her are profoundly
      calming and invigorating all at the same time. Gail speaks softly yet
      carries a big heart. My recommendations: if you are looking for calmness,
      ease and inner peace, Gail and Holy Fire Reiki will provide that. I have
      weekly sessions that keep me peaceful, grounded and on purpose. Thank you
      Gail for your expression of love through Reiki!"  '
  - author: Meredith M.
    quote: '"Gail has a calm demeanor that invites relaxation. Her Reiki session was
      soothing and I left feeling balanced. The stress of my day melted away and
      I was in a much more positive frame of mind afterward. I highly recommend
      a series of sessions with Gail as part of regular self-care."'

    awakens your body's own ability to heal. The session consists of a brief
    consultation and then application of healing energy on or just above the
    body. As Reiki raises and balances the natural flow of energy, physical
    symptoms and emotional distress clear naturally.
