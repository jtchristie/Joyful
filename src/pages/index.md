  Living Reiki. Reiki is a subtle yet powerful energy healing technique. It

        An in-person Reiki session will take place in a peaceful, private space
        with soft lighting and soothing music. You sit or lie down while Reiki
        energy is applied in-person or at a distance to your body. There is no
        pressure or massaging, making it ideal for treating all ages and
        conditions. A typical session lasts 60 to 90 minutes.

        Reiki is a gift of life force energy given to us to renew and heal
        ourselves and others. The Holy Fire III Reiki placement (similar to an
        attunement) sensitizes you to the frequency of Reiki energy by opening
        your energy field, clearing blocked energy, and allowing you to become a
        clear channel for Reiki healing.

        The following classes all include Holy Fire Reiki energies. Reiki energy is constantly evolving and Holy Fire III is one of the most recent forms. It is both powerful and gentle. It is noticeably refined and provides purification, healing, and guidance. It carries a very high vibration, which improves your connection to universal energy and unconditional love.

        Reiki has a rich history, originating in Japan in 1865. The name Reiki
        comes from two Japanese words, "Rei" meaning Higher Consciousness, and
        "Ki" life force energy. When this spiritually guided life force energy
        restores the subtle, natural flow of energy, your physical symptoms and
        emotional distress clear naturally. Reiki helps balance and harmonize
        your body, mind and spirit.
