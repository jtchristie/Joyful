### Reiki really works
Multiple studies have proven the very real positive affects of Reiki. For example people who have been treated with reiki with cancer in addition to medical care had lower levels of pain, anxiety and fatigue. 

### Enhances quality of life
A 2016 study shows that women who had reiki showed improvements in their sleep patterns, self-confidence and depression levels. Patients noted a sense of calm, inner peace, and relaxation.
